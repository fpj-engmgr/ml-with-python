Supervised vs unsupervised learning

What is Supervised learning?
- We teach the model with labeled Dataset
  - attributes of each row of data (observation) with labeling of data coming together into a class  
  - Types of supervised learning
    - Classifation
      - process of predicting discrete class labels or categories
    - Regression
      - Process of predicting continuous values


Unsupervised learning
- Model works on its own to discover information about unlabeled data
- Techniques:
  - Dimension reduction
  - Density estimation
  - Market basket analysis 
  - Clustering
    - Discovering structure
    - Summarization
    - Anomaly detection

Getting data into Python

Two important properties
1. Format
2. Path

pandas
- read_csv example:

import pandas as pandas
url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data"
df = pd.read_csv(url, header = None)
- df = data frame

df.head(n) prints first n rows of data frame
df.tail(n) prints last n rows of data frame

headers = ["symboling", "normalized-losses", "make", "fuel-type", "aspiration", "num-of-doors", "body-style",
"drive-wheels", "engine-location", "wheel-base", "length", "width", "curb-weight", "engine-type", "num-of-cylinders",
"engine-size", "fuel-system", "bore", "stroke", "compression-ratio", "horsepower", "peak-rpm", "city-mpg", 
"highway-mpg", "price"]

 df.columns = headers

- export data to read_csv:
 df.to_csv(path)
