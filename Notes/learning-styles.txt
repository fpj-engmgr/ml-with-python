Supervised vs unsupervised learning

What is Supervised learning?
- We teach the model with labeled Dataset
  - attributes of each row of data (observation) with labeling of data coming together into a class  
  - Types of supervised learning
    - Classifation
      - process of predicting discrete class labels or categories
    - Regression
      - Process of predicting continuous values


Unsupervised learning
- Model works on its own to discover information about unlabeled data
- Techniques:
  - Dimension reduction
  - Density estimation
  - Market basket analysis 
  - Clustering
    - Discovering structure
    - Summarization
    - Anomaly detection
