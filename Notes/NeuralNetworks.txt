Neural Networks

input -> soma -> output

- soma may have hidden layers

1. Forward Propagation
  - activation function (e.g. Sigmoid function)
    - should the neuron be activated or not?
      z = w1 . x1 + b1
      - w1 = weight
      - b1 = bias
    - for a network with 2 neurons, the output of the first neuron is the input of the second neuron
