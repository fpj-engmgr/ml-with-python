Target variable is a categorical attrivute.

- e.g. loan default prediction
- e.g. drug class response is typically multi-class

Algorithms for classification
- Decision trees
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Discriminat Analysis
- k-Nearest Neighbor
- Logistic Regression- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbor

- Classify based on similarity to near neighbors

Building Decision trees

Drug Dataset
- Select attributes based on
