Linear Regression 
- Use of a single independent variable to predict
- Use of multiple variables...Multiple Linear Regression

Simple Linear regression (fast, no tuning of parameters, easy to understand)
- Take a linear fit of the data
- aka y = theta(0) + theta(1)*x
- coefficient is calculated (aka slope)
- calculate the error against the fitted linear
  - Mean Residual Error is an indicator of quality of fit
  - aka R^2 (MSE)
- How to find the best fit?
  - Mathematical approach
    - calculate mean of independent and dependent variables
      - theta(1) = sum((x(i) - x-mean)(y(i) - y-mean))/sum)(x(i) - x-mean)^2)
      - theta(0) = y-mean - theta(1)*x-mean
- Optimization approach

Model Evaluation
- Train and Test on same dataset
  - Test set is a subset of only independent variables
    - Compare the predictions with the actual value_counts
      - Calculate the error
- Train/Test Split
  - Use part for training
  - Rest for testing
  - Better for out-of-sample accuracy!

Regression Evaluation Metrics
-

Training accuracy
- percentage of correct predictions when using the test dataset

Out-of-Sample accuracy
- percentage of correct predictions on data that the model has not been trained on

We want high out-of-sample accuracy!

K-fold cross-validation
- split dataset in K-folds
  - use part for test and rest for training
  - average the accuracy of each of the folds

Accuracy Metrics
- MAE  - mean absolute error 
- MSE  - mean squared error
- RMSE - root mean squared error
- RSE  - relative squared error
- R^2 = 1 - RSE

Multiple Linear Regression
- Multiple independent variables to predict

- Independent variables effectiveness on predition 
- Predict the impact of changes

Find the theta vector
- Ordinary Least Squares
  - Minimize the MSE using linear algebra
  - Time consuming...ok for less than 10K rows
- Optimization algorithms
  - Gradient Descent
    - reduce error iteratively
    - good for a large dataset

How many independent variables to use...
- Just the right number
- Don't overfit, as it loses power of predictions
- Should independent variables be continuous
- Linear relationship should exist for each independent variable with the dependent one!
