Descriptive Statistics

- Summarize using pandas describe() method 
- Summarize categorical data by using value_counts() method
- Box plots provide a good way to see range around median, extremes and outliers
- Scatter plots for continuous variables

GroupBy
- panda dataframe.groupby() method
  = Can apply to categorical variables
  - Group into categories
  - Single or multiple variables
Example:
df_test = df[['drive-wheels', 'body-style', 'price']]
df_grp = df_test.groupby(['drive-wheels', 'body-style'], as_index=False).mean()
# pivot table
df_pivot = df_grp.pivot(index='drive-wheels', columns='body-style')
