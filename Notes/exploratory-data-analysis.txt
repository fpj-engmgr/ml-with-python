Exploratory Data Analysis

Focus on getting started with data analysis 
- Summarize main characteristics of the data
- Gain a better understanding of the data set 
- Uncover relationships between variables
- Extract important variables


Quetions
- What are the characteristics which have the most impact on the car price?

- Descriptive Statistics
- GroupBy
- ANOVA
- Correlation
- Correlation - Statistics

Descriptive Statistics

- Summarize using pandas describe() method 
- Summarize categorical data by using value_counts() method
- Box plots provide a good way to see range around median, extremes and outliers
- Scatter plots for continuous variables

GroupBy
- panda dataframe.groupby() method
  = Can apply to categorical variables
  - Group into categories
  - Single or multiple variables
Example:
df_test = df[['drive-wheels', 'body-style', 'price']]
df_grp = df_test.groupby(['drive-wheels', 'body-style'], as_index=False).mean()
# pivot table
df_pivot = df_grp.pivot(index='drive-wheels', columns='body-style')

Correlation between variables
- Measures to what extent different variables are interdependent

Pearson CorrelationMeasure the strength of the correlation between two features
- Correlation coefficient
    - Close to +1: Large positive relationship
    - Close to -1: Large negative relationship
    - Close to 0: No relationship
- P-value
  - P-value < 0.001: strong certainty in the result
  - P-value < 0.05:  moderate certainty in the result
  - P-value < 0.1:   weak certainty in the result
  - P-value > 0.1:   No certainty in the result
