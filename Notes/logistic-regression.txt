Classification Method

What is Logistic Regression

- classification algorithm for categorical variables
- predict a binary outcome
- independent variables should be continuous


Applications for Logistic regression
- predict probabiity of a heart attack
- predict mortality in injured patients
- predict curomter propensity to buy a product
- predict probabiity of failure
- predict likelihood of homeowner defaulting on a mortgage  

When to use Logistic Regression
- data is binary
- need probablistic results
- you need a linear decision boundary
- you need to understand the impact of a feature

To get probability of belonging to a class use sigmoid
- returns the 

Minimizing the cost function of a model

- Use gradient descent optimization approach
- Gradient descent is iterative approach to find minimum of the function
  - Partial derivative of the function
