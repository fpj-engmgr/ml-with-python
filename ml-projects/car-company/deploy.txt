You can also deploy your model via Web Application or Web App . This allows users to interact with your model like a website. They can upload the image with a user interface and view the results. Let's see how we can deploy a web app in CV Studio. In CV Studio, go to the use model section and select New Application. Fill out the window as follows,  giving  your model a name and selecting the Model in this project, select **TEST - 1-click Deploy your Model to Cloud (Code Engine)** and  select the model from the  training run as shown here:

Then once the window is filled out press the Create Application button and your model will begin deploying.

Wait until the status changes from "deploying" to "ready". Once the status changes to ready, your application is ready for you to use!
